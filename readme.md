##### About
- Lightweight Event Dispatcher, allow you to dispatch data from callback hell, or any other complicated computations, integrated callback memory support - when not subscribed. Code validated with lint, Chaining support
- Available on `Node.js` and `Browser`

#### Why use it ?
- Avoid ugly callback > callback > callback hell!
- Avoid messy Promises
- Prefer clean, readable code hierarchy
- Easy to implement and use


#### Installation:
- If you want to use `npm run lint` then you have to run:`npm i`, otherwise there are no other dependencies to worry about!

#### Examples:
- examples are available in `node ./examples.js`

### Methods:
- `subscribe((data,uid,index)=>)`: start listening for events, before or after `next()`
    - `data`: any data send by `next()` will be outputed here
    - `uid`: provides job id, you assigned, or one generated by the class, usefull when dealing with promises
    - `index`: counts all callback to each job uid

- `next(data)/emit(data)`: sends data to `subscribe` callback. Can be declared before `subscribe` was initialized, there are no timers, so do not worry about memory leaks! 

- `del()/delete()/unsubscribe()`: remove dispatcher from stack

- `isActive():boolean`: tells you if dispatcher is still active, in case you set to delete it somewhere!
